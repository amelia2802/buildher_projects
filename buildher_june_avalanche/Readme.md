## My process

### What I learned
 #### Avalanche Network Architecture:

Gained a high-level understanding of Avalanche's unique consensus mechanism and network structure.

 #### Subnet Deployment:

Learned to deploy and configure subnets within the Avalanche network for customized and scalable blockchain solutions.

 #### Teleporter Bridge Deployment:

Acquired hands-on experience in deploying a Teleporter bridge for cross-chain communication, including sending, receiving, and verifying messages using Teleporter and Foundry.

This project enhanced my practical skills in blockchain technology and network deployment, preparing me for advanced work in decentralized networks.

### Useful resources

- [avalanche-starter-kit](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-starter-kit/) - This helped me to deploy subnet.
