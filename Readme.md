## Overview
This repository documents my learning journey and progress through various tasks aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of blockchain with different tools. The tasks include setting up a development environment, creating and deploying smart contracts, and interacting with them using various libraries and frameworks.
This learning journey has provided a solid foundation in Ethereum smart contract development, deployment, and interaction. By working through practical tasks and publishing progress on GitHub, I've gained hands-on experience and built a portfolio of code that demonstrates my understanding of these concepts. This README provides an overview of the tasks completed, the code written, and the key learnings from each exercise.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to Aleo, F3, & BUILDH3R for organizing the workshop and allowing us to work on such impactful projects. Additionally, I appreciate the support and guidance received from the mentors throughout the event. This project wouldn't have been possible without their contributions and encouragement.
